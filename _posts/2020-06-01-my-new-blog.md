I had this idea for a blog post, but nowhere to post it. Tired of all the other solutions I decided to redesign my [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} website and turn it into a blog.

But in the meantime I completely forgot what I had in mind when I started out.
Now, I'm more interested in brushing up my [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} skills and playing around with [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout){:target="_blank"} and the fairly new media query [prefers-color-scheme](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#descdef-media-prefers-color-scheme){:target="_blank"}.

So, now I have my new blog and eventually I'm sure that I will find interesting topics to write about.
